# Data Structures Assignment 1

1. created an array with all of the URLs in it
2. Created a for loop to run through each URL in the array
3. Made a function for the iteration
4. Inside the function, I created a variable removing everything but the "m" number, in order to write the path to a text file with that name
5. Made the request
6. Wrote it to the path + new variable + .txt
7. Added a console log to make sure everything worked

## Lessons learned

1. Tried multiple variations of a for loop until I found one that worked
2. Replace is your friend!
3. Make sure to include the folder path otherwise you'll end up with a messy file structure
4. Don't try to run through two arrays at once (at least until you figure out how to do it right)
